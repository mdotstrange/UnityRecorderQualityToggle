# UnityRecorderQualityToggle
* A simple script to toggle Quality settings when pressing Record/Stop Recording on Unity Recorder
* I'm making a 4k animated feature film with 4k textures with a 1070ti so I need to use low quality settings while working in Unity, that is what this script is for.

* Setup your quality settings

* Set the online and offline index for your quality settings

* The script will auto toggle your offline/online settings for you (online when recording, offline when you are not)
